This is a hobby project that involves creating a 3D Ludo game using sveltekit and ThreeJS. 

The current state of the game is just a prototype for core functionalities. In the future, I aim to work on adding AI mechanics to the game so users can play with bots with different difficulties.

Eventually, a WebSocket service will be set up to enable multiplayer gameplay.
